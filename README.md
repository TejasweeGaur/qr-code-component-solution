## Features

- Responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Interactive elements with hover and focus states for improved user experience.

## My Approach

I approached this challenge by first analyzing the design and breaking it down into smaller components. I then used semantic HTML5 markup to structure the content and employed CSS custom properties for easy styling. Flexbox and CSS Grid were my go-to choices for creating the responsive layout while ensuring optimal alignment and positioning of elements.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and CSS Grid)
